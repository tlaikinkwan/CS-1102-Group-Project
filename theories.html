 <h2>Theories</h2>
 <p> Understanding public opinion in the age of big data requires an interdisciplinary per- spective. Therefore, both classical theories and modern frameworks are needed to be ana- lyzed. The following theories provide a con- ceptual foundation for analyzing how opinions are shaped, expressed, and interpreted through large-scale data technologies. </p>
 <h3>Agenda-Setting Theory</h3>
 <p> The agenda-setting theory is proposed by McCombs and Shaw (1972). The theory states that mass media does not tell people what to think, but rather what to think about. In the digital age, this concept extends to algorithmi- cally created content on social media platforms. Trending topics and content visibility can in- fluence collective attention. This phenomenon makes agenda-setting an essential lens for in- terpreting large-scale opinion dynamics derived from social media data (McCombs, 2005). </p>
 <h3>Spiral of Silence Theory</h3>
 <p> The spiral of silence theory is introduced by Noelle-Neumann (1974). It suggests that individuals may withhold expressing minority opinions due to fear of social isolation. In big data contexts, this can be detected through anomalies in user engagement or sentiment trends. Computational tools enable researchers to observe where and when silence dominates. And they can also offer indirect insights into public sentiments (Gearhart Zhang, 2015). </p>
 <h3>Sentiment Analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h3>
 <p> Sentiment analysis is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP). It provides a method for classifying public opinion across massive textual datasets. While it is not a social theory per se, it draws upon linguistic and psychological theories. These theories are mainly about affect and cognition to compu- tationally infer emotional valence from written expressions (Pang Lee, 2008). This approach is now fundamental in large-scale opinion mining and political forecasting. </p>
 <h3>Diffusion of Innovations Theory</h3>
 <p> Rogers' (2003) diffusion of innovations the- ory explains how ideas and technologies spread through a population. In public opinion re- search, it helps explain how narratives or online discourse can gain traction and spread virally across networks. This theory is particularly relevant in analyzing the temporal and spatial patterns of online opinion formation. </p>
 <h3>Computational Social Science</h3>
 <p> Computational social science is an emerging field that integrates social theories with algo- rithmic techniques to analyze human behavior at scale (Lazer et al., 2009). It provides the methodological backbone for public opinion analysis using big data. Also, it enables re- searchers to study phenomena such as opinion polarization, echo chambers, and collective be- havior through simulations, network analysis, and machine learning models. </p>
 <h3>Algorithmic Bias and Digital Ethics</h3>
 <p> Concerns have emerged over algorithmic bias and the ethical implications of data-driven systems. Algorithmic bias refers to systematic and repeatable errors in algorithmic decision- making that create unfair outcomes(Noble, 2018). For example, recommendation algo- rithms may disproportionately amplify certain political views. And this may further lead to the formation of echo chambers and the marginal- ization of opinions. </p>
 <p> In the era of big data, an ethical lens to public opinion analysis ensures fairness, transparency, and inclusivity. The results depend on how big data technologies are designed and deployed. This theoretical approach helps contextualize how such technologies can both reflect and distort public sentiment. </p>
