 <h2>Our Proposed Solutions</h2>
 <h3>Challenges with Public Opinion Analysis</h3>
 <p> Big data processing has always faced the challenge of data quality and accuracy, and lack a standardized data cleaning and interpret- ing process. While public opinion analysis has faced challenges when dealing with irrelevant information and human bias. </p>
 <h3>Research Gap</h3>
 <p> Integrate LLM and classical sentiment anal- ysis tool such as Inverse Document Frequency and classical sentiment analysis calculation method to result in a higher sentimental accu- racy, high quality result human bias free result </p>
 <h3>Our Proposed Methodology</h3>
 <p> Fetch data: Leverage programming lan- guages such as Python to do web scraping via social media platforms APIs such as Reddit, X, Facebook, Youtube etc. </p>
 <p> Sandwich Method:
    <ol type = "1">
     <li>Use LLM to translate it into sentiment analysis tool readable text, which includes: Normalize slang and abbreviations, remove sarcasm or explain it explicitly, translate text into English or standard formats and ensure grammar consistency and clarity. This prevents information loss due to noisy or ambiguous text and reduces human-induced preprocessing bias. </li>
     <li>Use sentiment analysis tools to learn about the public sentiment. This enables us to have a mathematical understanding of the general pub- lic sentiment aggregated from their opinions. Which prevents human bias such as selection bias. </li>
     <li>Calculate the Inverse Document Fre- quency to capture the more frequently oc- curring public comments, which mathemati- cally demonstrates the importance of opinion- bearing words. </li>
     <li>Promt LLM to summarize the major com- ments/opinion </li>
    </ol> 
 <p> The method creates multiple advantages. In- cluding handling slang, vague and ambigu- ous text, mitigating bias in interpretation, and providing summarization that aligns with the occurrence frequency level. </p>
